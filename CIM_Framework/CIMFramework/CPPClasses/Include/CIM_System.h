//  Contents:   CIM_System represents an entity made up of component parts (defined by the SystemComponent relationship), that operates as a 'functional whole'. Systems are top-level objects in the CIM hierarchy, requiring no scoping or weak relationships in order to exist and have context. It should be reasonable to uniquely name and manage a System at an enterprise level. For example, a ComputerSystem is a kind of System that can be uniquely named and independently managed in an enterprise. However, these qualities are not true for the power supply (or the power supply sub-'system') within the computer. 
//              
//              Although a System can be viewed as a Collection, this view is not the correct model. A Collection is simply a 'bag' that 'holds' its members. A System is a higher-level abstraction, built out of its individual components. It is more than the sum of its parts. Note that System is a subclass of EnabledLogicalElement which allows the entire abstraction to be functionally enabled or disabled at a higher level than enabling or disabling its component parts.
